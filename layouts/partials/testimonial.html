                  I just couldn’t bear the thought of letting my Mum live all alone. It just wouldn’t be right. Now, with Julia around, Mum gets to experience the joy (and sometimes the challenges) of Julia’s experimental cooking. Plus, I don’t have to field as many calls about how to work the darn computer anymore!

                  My dear Dad has reached that age where it’s just safer to have someone around in case anything happens. Bringing in a companion was the perfect solution. Now, Jeffery’s there, and they’ve even started tackling that kitchen table repainting Dad’s been talking about forever.

                  My brother and I were worried about finding the right solution for Mum, especially with her being alone at night. We were considering care homes, when we stumbled upon Companion Helper. Since then, Mum has been delighted with her companion, who is even helping her brush up on her French! It’s such a relief knowing she’s not alone.

                  Danielle has truly been a gift since she joined my household. It's not just the practical assistance that makes a difference; it's the good company and support she provides.

                  Sharing a space with Joslin has been such a delight and we've even started inside jokes! I never wanted to live alone, and having such a homely place with Joslin has truly made a difference. I'm even getting invaluable household tips!
