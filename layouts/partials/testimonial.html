              I just couldn’t bear the thought of letting my Mum live all alone. It just wouldn’t be right. Now, with Julia around, Mum gets to experience the joy (and sometimes the challenges) of Julia’s experimental cooking. Plus, I don’t have to field as many calls about how to work the darn computer anymore!

              My dear Dad has reached that age where it’s just safer to have someone around in case anything happens. Bringing in a companion was the perfect solution. Now, Jeffery’s there, and they’ve even started tackling that kitchen table repainting Dad’s been talking about forever.

              Having Emma as a companion has been a game-changer. We share stories, go for walks, and she even helps me with my garden. It’s like having a friend who’s always there when I need her.

              My grandmother was hesitant at first, but her companion, Lisa, has brought so much joy into her life. They play cards, watch old movies, and Lisa even taught her how to use a smartphone!
