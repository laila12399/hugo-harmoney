                  I just couldn’t bear the thought of letting my Mum live all alone. It just wouldn’t be right. Now, with Julia around, Mum gets to experience the joy (and sometimes the challenges) of Julia’s experimental cooking. Plus, I don’t have to field as many calls about how to work the darn computer anymore!

                  My Dad has reached that age where it’s safer to have someone around in case anything happens. Bringing in a companion was perfect. Jeffery’s there, and they’ve even started tackling that kitchen table repainting Dad’s been talking about forever.

                  My brother and I were worried about Mum, especially at night. We considered care homes, then found Companion Helper. Mum’s delighted with her companion, who’s even helping her brush up on French! It’s such a relief.

                  Sharing a home with Joslin has been a delight—we’ve even started inside jokes! I never wanted to live alone, and this has made such a difference. I’m learning household tips too!
